# DSA
Data Structure and Algorithms

1. A computer program is a collection of instructions to perform a specific task.
2. For this, a computer program may need to store data, retrieve data, and perform computations on the data.
3. A data structure is a named location that can be used to store and organize data.
4. An algorithm is a collection of steps to solve a particular problems.
5. Learning data structures and algorithms allow us to write efficient and optimized computer programs.
