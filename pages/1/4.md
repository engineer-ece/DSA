# Master Theorem

1. Master theorem for solving recurrence relations.
2. The master method is a formula for solving recurrence relations of the forms:

```
T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n).
where,
n    = size of input
a    = number of subproblems in the recursion
n/b  = size of each subproblem. All subproblems are assumed to have the same size.
f(n) = cost of the work done outside the recursive call, which includes the cost of dividing the problem and cost of merging  the solutions.

Here, a ≥ 1 and  b > 1 are constants, and f(n) is an asymptotically positive functions.

```
3. An asymptotically positive function means that for a sufficiently large value of **n**, we have **f(n)>0**.

```
Master theorem is used in calculating the time complexity of recurrence relations ( divide and conquer algorithms) in a simple and quick way.

### Master Theorem Explanation:

1. If **a ≥ 1** and **b > 1** are constants and **f(n)** is an asymptotically positive function, then the time complexity of a recursive relation is given by,

```
T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n)
where, T(n) has the following asymptotic bounds:
    1. If f(n) = O(n^(logₘa-𝛆)), then T(n) = 𝛉(n^(log)ₘa).
    2. If f(n) = 𝛉(n^(logₘa)), then T(n) = 𝛉(n^(log)ₘa * log n).
    3. If f(n) = 𝛀(n^(logₘa+𝛆), then T(n) = 𝛉(f(n)).
𝛆 > 0 is a constant.
```
