# What is an Algorithm?

An algorithmm is a set of well-defined instruction in sequence to solve a problem.

# Qualities of a good Algorithm:

1. Input and Output should be defined precisely.
2. Each step in the algorithm should be clear and unambiguous
3. Algorithms should be most effective among many different ways to solve a problems.
4. An algorithm shouldn't include computer code. Instead, the algorithm should be written in such a way that it can be used in different programming languages.


# Algorithm Examples
 
  1. Algorithm to add two numbers 
  2. Algorithm to find the largest among three numbers
  3. Algorithm to find all the roots of the quadratic equation
  4. Algorithm to find the factorial
  5. Algorithm to check prime number
  6. Algorithm to Fibonacci series

### 1. Algorithm to add two number.


```
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Declare variables num1, num2 and sum.
Step 3: Read values num1 and num2.
Step 4: Add num1 and num2 and assign the result to sum.
        sum <- num1 + num2
Step 5: Display sum
Step 6: Stop
```

### 2. Algorithm to find the largest among three numbers


```
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Declare variables a,b and c.
Step 3: Read variables a,b and c.
Step 4: If a > b
           If a > c
              Display a is the largest number. 
           Else 
              Display c is the largest number.
        Else
           If b > c
              Display b is the largest number.
           Else
              Display c is the largest number.
Step 5: Stop  

```


### 3. Write an algorithm to find all roots of a quadratic equation ax²+bx+c = 0

```
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Declare variables a, b, c, D, x1, x2, rp and ip;
Step 3: Calculate discriminant
        D <- b2-4ac
Step 4: If D >= 0 
                r1 <- (-b+√D)/2a
                r2 <- (-b-√D)/2a
                Display r1 and r2 as roots.
        Else
            Calculate real part and imaginary part
            rp <- -b/2a
            ip <- √-D/2a
            Display rp+j(ip) and rp-j(ip) as roots
Step 5: Stop 
```

### 4. Algorithm to find a factorial


```
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Declare variables n, factorial and i.
Step 3: Initialize variables
          factorial <- 1
          i <- 1
Step 4: Read value of n
Step 5: Repeat the steps until i = n
     5.1 factorial <- factorial * i
     5.2 i <- i+1
Step 6: Display factorial
Step 7: Stop
```

### 5. Write an algorithm to check whether a number entered by the user is prime or not.


```
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Declare variables n, i, flag.
Step 3: Initialize variables
        flag <- 1
        i <- 2
Step 4: Read n from the user.
Step 5: Repeat the steps until i=(n/2)
     5.1 If remainder of n+i equals 0
            flag <- 0
            Go to step 6
     5.2 i <- i+1
Step 6: If flag = 0
           Display n is not prime.
        Else 
           Display n is prime
Step 7: Stop
     
```

### 6. Write an algorithm to find the Fibonacci series till term <= 1000.

```
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Declare variables first_term,second_term and temp.
Step 3: Initialize variables first_term <- 0 second_term <- 1
Step 4: Display first_term and second_term.
Step 5: Repeat the steps until second_term <= 1000.
     5.1: temp <- second_term
     5.2: second_term <- second_term + first_term
     5.3: first_term <- temp
     5.4: Display second_term.
Step 6: Stop.

```
