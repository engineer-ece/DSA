# What is an Algorithm?

An algorithmm is a set of well-defined instruction in sequence to solve a problem.

# Qualities of a good Algorithm:

1. Input and Output should be defined precisely.
2. Each step in the algorithm should be clear and unambiguous
3. Algorithms should be most effective among many different ways to solve a problems.
4. An algorithm shouldn't include computer code. Instead, the algorithm should be written in such a way that it can be used in different programming languages.


# Algorithm Examples
 
  1. Algorithm to add two numbers 
  2. Algorithm to find the largest among three numbers
  3. Algorithm to find all the roots of the quadratic equation
  4. Algorithm to find the factorial
  5. Algorithm to check prime number
  6. Algorithm to Fibonacci series

1. Algorithm to add two number.

```
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Declare variables num1, num2 and sum.
Step 3: Read values num1 and num2.
Step 4: Add num1 and num2 and assign the result to sum.
        sum <- num1 + num2
Step 5: Display sum
Step 6: Stop
```
